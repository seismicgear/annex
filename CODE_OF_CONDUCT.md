# Code of Conduct

## Standards

This project values direct, technically rigorous collaboration. The following standards apply to all interactions in issues, pull requests, discussions, and any other project spaces.

**Expected:**

- Technical disagreement grounded in evidence. Argue the idea, not the person.
- Clear, honest communication. Say what you mean. If you don't know, say so.
- Respect for the time and effort of maintainers and other contributors.
- Good-faith engagement with project constraints, including the non-negotiable principles in [FOUNDATIONS.md](FOUNDATIONS.md).

**Not tolerated:**

- Personal attacks, harassment, or intimidation.
- Discriminatory language or behavior directed at any individual or group.
- Deliberately introducing code that enables surveillance, identity harvesting, behavioral tracking, or centralized control — regardless of the stated justification.
- Misrepresenting the intent or effect of a contribution.
- Persistent disruption of discussions or review processes.

## Constitutional Constraints

Annex has architectural and ethical principles documented in [FOUNDATIONS.md](FOUNDATIONS.md) that are permanent and non-negotiable. Contributions that conflict with these principles will be rejected. This is not a matter of opinion or consensus — it is a design constraint of the project.

If you believe a Foundation principle is wrong, you are free to fork the project under the terms of the [license](LICENSE.md). You are not free to change the Foundations through social pressure, vote, or sustained argument within this project.

## Security-Critical Work

Contributions to security-critical subsystems (ZK circuits, VRP trust negotiation, federation protocol, cryptographic primitives) are held to a higher standard of review. This is not gatekeeping — it is proportional to the risk those systems carry. Expect more questions, more scrutiny, and longer review cycles on these PRs.

## Enforcement

Maintainers may remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, issues, and other contributions that violate this Code of Conduct. Repeated or severe violations may result in temporary or permanent exclusion from project spaces.

Enforcement decisions are made by project maintainers and are final.

## Reporting

If you experience or witness behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, email contact@montgomerykuykendall.com.

//! RTX (Recursive Thought Exchange) knowledge exchange for the Annex platform.
//!
//! Implements structured agent-to-agent knowledge transfer: reflection
//! summary bundles, publish/subscribe, transfer scope enforcement,
//! cross-server relay, and governance-mediated auditing.
//!
//! RTX enables distributed cognition across the Annex federation. An agent
//! on one server can package a reflection, publish it, and have it delivered
//! to aligned agents on federated servers — gated at every step by VRP
//! transfer scope and capability contracts.
//!
//! # Phase 9 implementation
//!
//! The full implementation of this crate is Phase 9 of the roadmap.
